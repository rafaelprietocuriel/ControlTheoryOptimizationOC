# Title: Cartel Participation Model â€“ Individual and Collective Simulation
#
# Description:
# This R script simulates a cartel participation model at both the 
# individual and collective levels. It includes routines to generate 
# figures that illustrate the dynamics and outcomes of the simulation.
# It also captures the optimal size of cartel depending on the personal costs
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

#### logic
# M people
# binary variable for A being part of a cartel
