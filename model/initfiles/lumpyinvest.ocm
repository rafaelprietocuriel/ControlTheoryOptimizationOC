  % abstract =    {This paper considers a firm that has the option to undertake product
	% innovations. For each product innovation the firm has to install
	% a new production plant. We find that investments are larger and occur
	% in a later stadium when more of the old capital stock needs to be
	% scrapped. Moreover, we obtain that the firmï¿½s investments increase
	% when the technology produces more profitable products. We see that
	% the firm in the beginning of the planning period adopts new technologies
	% faster as time proceeds, but later on the opposite happens. Furthermore,
	% we find that the firm does not invest such that marginal profit is
	% zero, but instead marginal profit is negative. Moreover, we find
	% that if the time it takes to double the efficiency of technology
	% is larger than the time it takes for the capital stock to depreciate,
	% the firm undertakes an initial investment. Finally, we show that
	% when demand decreases over time and when fixed investment cost is
	% higher, that the firm invests less throughout the planning period,
	% the time between two investments increases and that the first investment
	% is delayed.},
